# Portfolio page in React Native

- the goal is to learn React Native by example

### Create expo APP using yarn

yarn create expo ./expo-demo --template

### ESLINT

- config default eslint from expo docs https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/
  - I needed to fix errors for import/resolver (fixed changing eslint settings and adding dependency for eslint-import-resolver-typescript)
  - I added rule for import/order + autofix
